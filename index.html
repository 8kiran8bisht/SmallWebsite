                The first route would be handled when someone visits the root domain of the website, i.e the homepage. The home page should contain : a header, a nav with 3 links, a main area with two sections that contains some content and a footer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second route should facilitate users when they navigate to  â€œ/contact-us'' This route should return a contact us page. The page should contain all of the above areas from the home page (a header, a nav with 3 links, a main area, footer). However for this main section, it should contain a contact us form. The contact us form should have  labels and form controls that will capture a user first and last name, phone number and their message.
